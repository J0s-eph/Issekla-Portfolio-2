1. Definitions
Adaptation: A work based on the original work, or based on the work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music, or other alterations. It also includes cinematographic adaptations or other forms where the work is transformed, recast, or adapted in a way that is recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purposes of this License. For clarity, if the work is musical, the synchronization of the work with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation.

Collection: A collection of literary, artistic works, performances, phonograms, or broadcasts, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above).

Distribute: To make available to the public the original and copies of the work or adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.

Licensor: The individual(s), entity/entities offering the work under the terms of this License.

Original Author: The individual(s) or entity/entities that created the work, or if no identifiable author exists, the publisher. In the case of a performance, this includes actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and others involved in interpreting the work.

Work: The literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License, including various types of expressions such as books, music, films, sculptures, photographs, performances, broadcasts, phonograms, and others.
